- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Jeric
- I'm a Full-stack Developer based in Manila. I love to create interactive web applications from backend, frontend and the infrastructure itself.

## My Tech Stack
- Generally, I'm always curious with new technologies in building applications.
- I'm a big fan of using PHP (Laravel) in the backend for most of my applications. I also like to create flexible backends using TypeScript (Node/Bun, Express, Nest) when needed.
- My go-to UI library is Vue. I also love using React for some of my apps. I'm currently learning other frontend technologies such as Svelte and Solid, including their metaframework counterparts (Nuxt, Next, SvelteKit, SolidStart).
- MySQL and Postgres are the primary databases I'm using. I'm also open in using NoSQL ones like MongoDB and Firestore, though.
- I like to use Docker in setting up my development environment, as well as using my images to deploy my apps.
